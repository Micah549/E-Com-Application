<h2>Use the below sections to help you find answers to commonly asked questions about shopping online with Alpha-Gen.</h2>

<p>If you don't see what you need, please feel free to get in touch with our team at mkviljoen@gmail.com.</p><br/>
<h2>WHAT IS CLICK & COLLECT?</h2>

<p>Click & Collect is the service that allows you to choose and pay for your food items online, 
    and collect them at the collection counter at Alpha-Gen once you have received the email confirming 
    that your order is ready for collection.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s a no-contact way to get your groceries. </p><br/>
<h2>CAN I PAY ON COLLECTION?</h2>

<p>Unfortunately payment has to be made upfront in full so that our team can get your order ready for collection.  
    You will pay online via the PayFast payment gateway and you can choose between a credit, 
    cheque or debit card or alternatively you can by via InstantEFT.</p><br/>
<h2>ONCE I'VE ORDERED, HOW LONG UNTIL I CAN COLLECT MY ORDER?</h2>

<p>While every effort will be taken to have your 
    order ready for you on the same day it was placed, due to order volumes and other factors 
    it may take up to three days to pick and pack all the items in your order.</p><br/>

<p>Once your order has been placed, please wait until you've received the second email confirming that your order is ready for collection. 
    Once you've received this second email you can come to collect.</p><br/>
<h2>HOW DO REFUNDS WORK?</h2>

<p>When you collect your order, if there are any missing or out of stock items on your order you will have the chance to be refunded at the collection counter. 
    Please be sure to bring your bank card with you so we can process the refund.</p><br/>
<h2>WHICH Alpha-Gen STORES OFFER THE CLICK & COLLECT SERVICE?</h2>

<p>Alpha-Gen is currently the ONLY Alpha-Gen store that offers the click & collect service at this stage.</p>

<p>We do not deliver orders just yet - you would need to collect - but we hope to offer this to you soon so keep an eye on our page!</p><br/>
<h2>CAN I HAVE MY ORDER DELIVERED TO ME?</h2>

<p>We do not deliver orders just yet - you will need to collect - 
but we hope to offer this to you soon so keep an eye on the website, on our Facebook page and the email newsletters!</p><br/>
<h2>CAN I ADD PRODUCTS TO MY ORDER WHEN I COME IN TO COLLECT?</h2>

<p>Once your order is confirmed and payment has been made,
 our team processes and picks your order, you would therefore not be able to add items and would
  need to go into the store to purchase any additional items.</p><br/>
<h2>WHAT IF I AM LATE ON THE DAY OF COLLECTION?</h2>

<p>Please contact the Online Team at Alpha-Gen if you are running late or if you can no longer collect your order, 
    and arrange an alternate collection date and time.</p><br/>

    <p>You can contact the team on <b>071 93600 23</b>, the extension is 5427.</p>
